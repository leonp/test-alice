Happy New Year, folks! I can't complain about 2013 really; I got to spend the summer researching and writing my MA dissertation, got a distinction for it, started my PhD (making some lovely new friends in the process), and had a fab holiday in Amsterdam when I wasn't working.




However, I don't intend to rest on my laurels in 2014. I hope to get a journal article accepted, present a paper at least one conference and pass my confirmation board. On the fun side, I'm planning to go to Berlin on holiday this year. And of course, I intend to keep doing a lengthy post on this blog every Friday.




Suppose I'd better get started!
