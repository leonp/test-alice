**Update: Helen Rogers has volunteered to take all the books of my hands.  Yay!**<strike>  
</strike>

<strike>So, my thesis is printed out and bound and ready to hand in on Friday.  Time for a bit of a clear-out!  Yesterday I went through all the books I’d accumulated and decided which ones to keep and give away.  I’m giving you, my lovely UK readers, first refusal of these rather random, but quite interesting if you’re into that sort of thing, only children’s autobiographies.    
</strike>

<strike>If they’re not gone by 20th July, they’re going to charity.  I’ll edit this post and cross off any that get claimed.  Although I’m giving them away for free, I literally have no idea when I’m getting paid for anything again (I know I nearly have enough for a YouGov reward…), so I’d appreciate a discretionary couple of quid for postage via PayPal or bank transfer.  They do have pencil marks in them, but if you REALLY hate pencil marks, let me know and I’ll rub them out.  Contact me on here, on Twitter (@alicetheunique) or email me (alice_violett at hotmail dot com (just to deter spam)).</strike>
