I’m _hoping _to spend today doing a lot of writing, so I thought I’d make thing a bit easier for myself by doing a more picture-based than text-based blog.  This is ‘My History Book’, not an actual history this time, more of an annual format/advertisement for myself really.  I’m guessing I was six when I wrote this one as well.

The cover promises you’ll learn about me.  You don’t, really.  But it’s copyrighted, so nobody can steal it.

This book was separate from the ‘storie books’ I usually wrote.  I only have maybe four decent story books, and I’m umming and aahing about whether to post them because they include people who might mind.

Oh, just get on with it.  I would still like to sell books I’ve written now that I am bigger.

I’m the one without glasses.  Anyone with a ponytail looked like Agnes from _Despicable Me_ in my drawings, anyone with really short hair just got a block.  Where are all the limbs?!

A fun activity and me apparently being stabbed by a ginormous pencil.

When I was little, I thought my school was really far away because it took a few twists and turns to get there.  It probably actually took 10-15 minutes to walk.  In the same vein, I once tried to take pretty much my entire tape collection on a trip to a supermarket about 10 miles away.

More blockheads.  I think maybe the message behind this was ‘men are silly, aren’t they?’

I have ‘Get Busy With Alice’ but there’s not a huge amount in it.  It also features a disproportionately-sized pencil.  Wondering if I adopted the phrase ‘Right On Time’ from the song.  Apparently you are commanded to like me by books 0 (I guess I started at 1, then realised I needed one before it), 1, and 2.

Can you also please screw in the bottom of the handle on the right door?  It’s come a bit loose.  I would join up the school and fix the door handle, but as you can see, I don’t have any arms.

And that’s where that book ends!  And now to continue to wage war on this chapter.
