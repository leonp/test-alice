>   * Oh, my hand  

> 

>   * The parchment is very hairy
> 

>   * Thank God it will soon be dark
> 

>   * St. Patrick of Armagh, deliver me from writing
> 

>   * Now I’ve written the whole thing; for Christ’s sake give me a drink  

> 

>   * Oh d fuckin abbot
> 

>   * Massive hangover
> 

>   * Whoever translated these Gospels did a very poor job  

> 

>   * Cursed be the pesty cat that urinated over this book during the night  

> 

>   * If someone else would like such a handsome book, come and look me up in Paris, across from the Notre Dame cathedral  

> 

>   * I shall remember, O Christ, that I am writing of Thee, because I am wrecked today
> 

>   * Do not reproach me concerning the letters, the ink is bad and the parchment scanty and the day is dark  

> 

>   * 11 golden letters, 8 shilling each; 700 letters with double shafts, 7 shilling for each hundred; and 35 quires of text, each 16 leaves, at 3 shilling each. For such an amount I won’t write again  

> 

>   * Here ends the second part of the title work of Brother Thomas Aquinas of the Dominican Order; very long, very verbose; and very tedious for the scribe; thank God, thank God, and again thank God
> 

>   * If anyone take away this book, let him die the death, let him be fried in a pan; let the falling sickness and fever seize him; let him be broken on the wheel, and hanged. Amen
