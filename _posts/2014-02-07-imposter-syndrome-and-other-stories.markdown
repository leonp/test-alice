So, more things were going to happen this week, but then they didn't because of **strikes**.  In both cases I support the strikes (London Underground and university staff) but I have less to write about than I planned.  I did, however, go to an enlightening **talk on imposter syndome** and do/read **a couple of interesting things**, so I'll blog about those.




Ever since I first heard the name for them, I've recognised myself as having **imposter feelings** - as distinct from **imposter syndrome**, where the fear of being exposed as a fraud influences your behaviour.  The most obvious example of this is my having received **AHRC funding** for my PhD.  Everyone talks about how prestigious it is, and rather than agreeing that yes, I must have done an extremely good application, I always think that **there can't have been much competition and they had to give the money to someone** or **they'll regret giving me the money when they find out I can't deliver**.




But I've thought about it, and I've actually had such feelings in other areas of **my life**.  The earliest example I can think of is the **11+** - which I passed, catapulting me from being a **big fish in ****a small pond** to a** small fish in a big pond**.  Suddenly, I was **average or below** and **hardly ever got praised for my work**, and for seven years I thought that my passing the 11+ was a **fluke**, or that **my intelligence peaked when I was 11** **and it was all downhill from there**.




I also feel like I'm only **imitating an adult**.  My feelings about adulthood have already been better explained by [this amazing famous blog post](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/this-is-why-ill-never-be-adult.html).  Every now and again, I feel like a **proper adult**, but then those feelings fade, and I think the fact I tend to congratulate myself when I do/say something mature or manage to **run the household** in my parents' absence without it burning down or being burgled or something terrible happening to the cat demonstrates that **I'm not really an adult**.  It's also part of the reason that at 25 I've never had a driving lesson - **I refuse to believe that anyone considers me mature enough to be allowed to drive a car**.  Silly, when you see some of the idiots on the roads - but that's another thing that puts me off.  Driving seems like a good way to get killed!  As well as being **ideologically opposed to marriage**, I also feel like I'm not really mature enough - **children can't get married**.  And don't get me started on the topic of **having children**.

Going back to **academic life**, my **first supervisory board** was one of the things that got postponed by the strikes, and now it's not until **February 27th**.  My supervisor and I had both wanted it earlier than that, but for different reasons - I said to him that I **just wanted it out of the way** and he reminded me that **it's supportive and not a trial**.  I think there's a big difference between how students and lecturers see boards - for students, there's a chance they might **hate everything you've done** and **realise that you shouldn't be ****doing the course after all**.  And even if you get through one board, **they might find you out at the next one**.




The speaker on Wednesday defined imposter feeling as **"the feeling of having misrepresented yourself despite objective evidence to the contrary"**.  I have all sorts of qualification certificates, good references and a house that is still standing, but my brain discounts all that and makes excuses like **"it was easy, they do say A Levels are getting easier" **or **"I only _just_ got a**** First"**.  Things is, unless you're a narcissist, there's no such thing as _feeling_ clever - to you, you're just **doing you****r job** and **getting on with things at a****n average rate**.  With me, **chronic low self-esteem** also comes into it.  Topically, I've read in books about **only children** that we find it difficult to become adults - see [last week's blog](http://t.co/3eQ7DcRV0n) about being on the threshold, for example. But the good news is **it's normal to have imposter feelings from time to time** (most of the time it's at the back of my mind and I do expect to get through this PhD, or at least have a good crack at it) and **it's better than being a narcissist**.




So, what else did I do this week?  Well, I helped set up the website/blog and Facebook and Twitter pages for the [Colchester Women's Oral History Project](http://colchesterwomen.wordpress.com).  I'm pushing this again because we need **interviewees** (aged around 60 and over and having lived in Colchester for a significant amount of time) and **transcribers** (accurate ones).




In my spare time, I'm currently reading _Flappers_ by Judith Mackrell.  Once again, something I'm reading for fun has ended up relating to my work - one of the women Mackrell writes about, **Nancy Cunard**, was an **only child** and had problems as a result - not least because her **upper-class parents were so distant**, making her **espe****cially lonely in childhood**.  Can't wait to read the next section about her.  It's also topical because I'm going to the **University History Society's Speakeasy Party** tonight, dressed as a **flapper** of course.
