This post is part-guide, part-reflection on the biographical dictionary that can be found on [ my Academia page](https://essex.academia.edu/AliceViolett/Papers).    I don’t know if it’ll be of interest to many people, but I have had one request for a list of my human sources, and that’s a good enough excuse for me to put it online and write a bit about it.

The possibility of compiling a biographical dictionary was put to me at the supervisory board I had in December.  It was suggested that, with all the people in my thesis who keep popping up in different chapters, it would be useful if readers could easily remind themselves their classes, dates of birth, and so on.  I agreed that it would make things easier - not just for the reader, but for me, as I wouldn’t have to keep going ‘this person, as you might remember from before…’  


I actually started putting my biographical dictionary together just after Christmas, but found it so tedious that I neglected it for a few months and put more effort into it over the past month, whenever I had a bit of non-thesis time.  I actually ended up finding it quite soothing and satisfying to do, once I got into the swing of it - I think my initial problem was that I hadn’t yet established a format for each entry.  Once I’d got that sorted, it required less thought.  Nonetheless, I made sure not to spend too much time in any one day on it, mixing it up with another task such as reading or marking!

Each entry contains a person’s name, reference (be it their autobiography, or oral history interview.  Some had ODNB entries I also put in), birth name (if known), year of birth and death (where known), places they were born and grew up, reason for being an only child (if given/hinted at), class, and occupation.  Naturally, some people’s entries were neater than others.  For example, when someone didn’t give a specific reason for being an only child, but mentioned that their parents were old, or their mother was ill, I was careful to say that, and when I couldn’t work out what class someone was, I was honest about it.

In the ‘public’ version of the dictionary, I’ve had to redact a few details, as a small number of the interviewees didn’t give full clearance for their oral histories.  I kept information that was in the summary on the British Library’s website anyway, but took out things you would only know if you listened to the recording/read the transcript.  Hopefully that’s okay.  I also had to be careful about finding out interviewees’ death years - I didn’t want to ‘doxx’ them, but at the same time, if their death years were in the public domain, either because they were well-known enough to have an online presence, or had an obituary in their local paper, it seemed expedient to include them in the dictionary.

Putting the dictionary together actually helped me correct parts of my thesis - in particular, the footnotes.  I hadn’t changed some copyright details that I was meant to have done, and I picked up on that by searching my thesis for people’s details.  I also found some footnotes that were missing all the appropriate information, as an earlier reference to the person in question had been deleted.  So that’s good.

Something that surprised me while putting the dictionary together was how many people’s life stories didn’t make it into my thesis.  I came across accounts I had completely forgotten about because they hadn’t contained information that was useful/vital to my thesis, as well as accounts that had seemed useful at the time I took notes from them, but turned out not to be in the end.  It reminded me of how small 80,000 words really is, and how much I could write if I didn’t have a word limit!
