Well, submission day seems very close now.  I may actually have to start considering which pub(s) to go to that evening.  This week I started my final re-read of my thesis.  I’ve already caught a few typos and (having had to change the margins to fit springback binders) orphaned ‘ibids’, but it is so boring!  I know my thesis inside out, so having to read it yet again is really dull, albeit very necessary.  I have no worries about finishing it on time, just so long as I keep myself caffeinated!

Other than that, this week I went on a crash course in statistics and SPSS, in an attempt to make myself more employable.  I’ve done statistics and SPSS before, but so long ago that I wouldn’t have been able to justify saying I could do them!  I found that I picked the concepts back up pretty quickly, so that made me feel good about myself - I continue to be a quick learner, and my brain isn’t too rusty!  It was good to do something new alongside covering the old ground of my thesis.

I also had my first job interview (for this phase of needing-a-job, not ever).  It would be great if I got the job and didn’t have to do any more, really - not only because it’s a job I really want (and I hope that showed in the interview!), but  I’ve spent the last two days in a constant state of ‘argh, I should have said x’, ‘argh, I shouldn’t have said y’, and ‘ugh, I’m never going to be the best person in any group of people’.  It’s exhausting and completely unnecessary - the decision is out of my hands, so worrying about it isn’t going to make any difference, but still my brain churns.

And then, of course, I have to print three copies of my thesis, two to go to my examiners, and one for my personal use.  Weird to think that all of this will be done this time next week.
