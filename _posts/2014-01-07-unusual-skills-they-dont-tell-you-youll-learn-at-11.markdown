Unusual skills they don’t tell you you’ll learn at postgrad level, #5: overstimulation by books.




I'm deadly serious.  This afternoon/evening after a library-related mishap meant my plans for finishing my literature review fell through, I read 120 or so pages of Christina Hardyment's _Dream Babies_ and my brain is buzzing with ideas.  Her bibliography contains a load of old childcare manuals I want to check out, she included in her work the views of one of them on the subject of only children, and I'm getting a load of ideas of the qualities parents were and weren't advised to cultivate in their children, and how these changed over time.  I'm getting ideas for research that doesn't fit neatly into my PhD but could make for some good blog posts if I find time to pursue it.  Yay!
