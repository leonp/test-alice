The ‘approval of title’ form is done. I’m due to hand in my thesis on Friday 8th July.  The countdown has begun!

This week, I’ve done some last-minute reading (I’ve definitely spent whole days reading books just to add one quote or sentence from them to my thesis), and, following my supervisor’s approval of my conclusion, started going back through my thesis with a fine-tooth comb.  It’s more time-consuming than the broad-brush approach I had with the last round of edits, but it’s definitely yielding results - I’ve already deleted 170 words from my introduction, and 603 words from my literature review.  It’s going to be alright.

Well, I don’t have time to do any more editing for a few days, because exam marking has landed.  I’ve never had to mark exams before, so it’ll be an experience.  It occurred to me this morning that now my course is totally done, so I won’t be receiving any more communication from my students.  I was a totally uncharismatic teacher, but I did like helping them.

**My ‘essential’ to-do list for the next six weeks:  
**Brutally edit introduction 
✓  
Brutally edit literature review 
✓  
Brutally edit ‘personality’ chapter  

Brutally edit 'feelings’ chapter  

Brutally edit ‘intense parenting’ chapter  

Brutally edit 'extended family and friends’ chapter  
Brutally edit conclusion  
Go over the whole thing at least one last time  
Exam marking  
Write paper for ‘Horrible Histories’ conference  
Look for jobs/work experience

It’s all starting to feel a bit real now, that I’ve nearly completed my thesis, and within three years too!  It really doesn’t seem that long ago that I started, and it’s so weird to think that what was a vague idea nearly four years ago, is now a comprehensive piece of work.  I’m excited, but continue to worry about ‘afterwards’.  I want to work in either publishing, social research, or the third sector - hopefully someone will have me!

Current state of my PhD desk.  Fewer library books than usual as it’s all editing from now on, but a few books I actually own in their place because I’ve run out of other places to put them.  I must admit, I am looking forward to clearing out some of the less interesting autobiographies I’ve accumulated…
