<h2>PhD archive</h2>

As my URL suggests, I have a PhD. It's called [<cite>The Public Perceptions and Personal Experience of Only Children, c. 1850-1950</cite>](http://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/) and took just under five years, which was two years longer than planned. The first three years were suspiciously easy, the unexpected fourth year was not, and I spent most of the fifth year waiting for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.

I blogged throughout my PhD, initially to a schedule of once a week, but far less frequently (yet arguably with more substance) once I found myself rewriting my entire thesis while working full-time. The [original blog is on Tumblr](https://aliceinacademia.tumblr.com), but I'm pretty sure that site won't last much longer, so I'm parking it here for anyone who wants to read it. This section is a **work-in-progress** - please keep checking back as I clean up more of my old posts!

I've weeded out unnecessary images (mostly because I can't be bothered to copy *everything* into my images folder) and reblogs (don't really work as a concept outside of Tumblr).
