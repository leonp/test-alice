## About me

I'm a web content editor with a PhD who loves books, cats, stationery, chocolate and bath stuff (not necessarily in that order).

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/alicetheunique), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-alice-violett-871710bb/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11934991-alice) and [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Shes_on_Fire).
